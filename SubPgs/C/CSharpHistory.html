            The Language C# was Developed while Net was under development Before the development of C# Net was using a language called "Simply Managed C". 
            In 1999 Anders Heilsberg Started development on C# but at the time it was called "C.O.O.L" C-Like Object Orented Language The name was considered 
            to be kept but Didn't due to trademark reasons. Once NET was announced in 2000 C# was given it's current name "C#" the class and net libraries had 
            also been ported to C#. The Designer of C# is Anders Heilsberg and had developed prior Turbo Pascal, Emberacado Delphini, and also J++. Many people 
            Had stated that C# is a Java Clone but Anders said that C# is more closely related to C++ instead.

            In 2005 C# 2.0 was released and with it was many features that would seperate C# from being a "Java Clone". C# has included features that would accomadate 
            "Functional-Style Programming" When C# 3.0 was released it came with many major features such as Lambda Epressions, Extention Methods, and Anonymas Types. 
            The features allowed C# Programmers to use Special Programming Tecniques like Clousures. LINQ was released with C# 3.0 allowing Developers to reduce the ammount 
            of Boiler Plate Code (Repeated Code). There was also a mascot for C# named Andy who was named after Anders Heilsberg But was Retired in 1984.
