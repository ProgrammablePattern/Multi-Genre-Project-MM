            Objective-C was created by Brad Cox in the early 1980s at the company Productivity Products International (PPI) Brad Cox orginally wanted to 
            Create a pre-processer for C and would add features from another language, and soon would have an object oriented version of C which he would 
            Call OOPC which stood for Object Oriented Pre-Compiler. Later a Person Named Love made a Company with Brad Cox named Productivity Products International 
            They would later release Objective-C and market it with a book named "Object-Oriented Programming, An Evolutionary Approuch" And Rename Their Company to 
            StepStone.

            In the Year 1988 the Company NeXT liscened Objective-C from StepStone They would also extend the compiler so it would support Objective-C. NeXT would go on 
            to Develop AppKit and the Foundation Kit Librairies which was where the NeXTSTEP User Interface was based on. They later sold NeXTSTEP as a Custom Programming 
            Platform. NeXT Originally planned on Shipping Objective-C Seprately from GCC But in the end Objective-C was shipped with GCC. Later when Apple Aquired NeXT 
            they used OpenStep in Mac OS X Which included Objective-C and NeXT's Objective-C Based Editor, Project Builder and the Interface Design Tool. Which in the end 
            was merged into Xcode. In 2014 Objective-C was Replaced by Swift.
