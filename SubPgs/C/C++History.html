            In the year 1979 a Danish Developer named Bjarne Stroustrup would start developing "C with Classes" Later replaced by C++, It was motivated by 
            his experience in programming for his thesis. He'd discovered a language named "Simula" that had many useful programming features, but he found that 
            it would run too slow, he had also found a language named "BCPL" but he found it was too low level for mainstream development. While he was working at 
            AT&T he would work on an enhanced version of C with some features of "Simula" built in. He chose C due to it's General Purpose, Speed, and widely used. 
            In 1982 he would work on the sucseccor to C with Classes named C++ it would add virtual Functions, Operator Overloading, Refrences, Constants, and Safer 
            Memory Allocation.

            Refrence to C++ in 1989 C++ 2.0 was released with an updated version of "The C++ Programming Language" it would add Inheritance, Static Member Functions, Const 
            Functions, and Protected Members. In 1990 "The Annotated C++ Manuel" was released. The later versions of C++ 2.0 would include Boolean (True / False) Types, 
            Templates, Exceptions, Namespaces, and New Casts. In 1998 C++ 98 was released which became the standard then in 2003 C++03 was released with minor bug fixes.
