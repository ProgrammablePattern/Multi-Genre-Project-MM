            Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes, in Brazil. Lua 1.0 had object constructors that would 
            be different from the current flexable style of Object Constructors. Control structures of Lua were borrowed from Modlula like If, while, Repeat/Return. 
            It had also taken influence from CLU like the Multiple assignments and returns, and had used the local variable from C++.

            Lua's Sematics and anonymas functions were influenced by Scheme. Versions of lua before 5.0 had the BSD Licence while 5.0 and onward has the MIT Licence.
