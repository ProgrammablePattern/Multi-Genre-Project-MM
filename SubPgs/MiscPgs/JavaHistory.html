            James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton the original creators of Java started the project in 1991. Java was originally designed for 
            Interactive television but was too advanced for the cable at the time originally the project was called Oak but was changes to Green then finally 
            Java. Java was designed after C and C++ to introduce familiarity to C and C++ programmers. Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0 in 1996 it was promised 
            that you only need to Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA is their slogan) it would provide no cost run-times and fairly good security that could be customized.
